Plant Breeders' Guide to R <br>A Webinar Series hosted by the [NAPB Education Committee](https://www.plantbreeding.org/)

### Abstract:
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the cornerstone activity that all researchers
should perform before conducting extensive analyses or decision making actives on
a new data set. There are two objectives behind conducting an EDA, the hypothesis
formulation cycle and data cleanup, both critical components in a plant breeding
program. The common phrase in computer science of â€˜garbage in, garbage outâ€™
appropriately applies to EDA and the importance it has in providing good quality
data for your research activities. Being successful with EDA is part asking the
right questions about your data and part knowing the right analyses and visualizations
to answer those questions. After todayâ€™s session, you should have a better idea
how to conduct those analyses and visualizations using R.

### Repository contents:
- Example files (see import_files/ and field_data.csv)
- RMarkdown file, so you can follow along with the session and change/see/tweak any of the code
- HTML file for you to follow along if you just want to see a pretty document of the code + outputs
